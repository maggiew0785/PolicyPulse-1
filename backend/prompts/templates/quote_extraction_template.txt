You are analyzing data from the subreddit '$subreddit', containing discussions about various aspects of $topic, including post titles, introductory text, and main content. The high-level theme we're interested in is '$theme'. Your task is to extract only the most relevant quotes, personal experiences, and opinions that explicitly mention or discuss concerns, risks, or implications related to $theme_focus.

Please process each row and output only quotes that:
1. Directly reference $theme_focus concerns.
2. Address specific risks, dangers, or ethical concerns related to $concerns_scope.
3. Include personal anecdotes or experiences discussing $theme_focus implications of $topic.

For each relevant quote, create an output entry in JSON format with the following structure:
- `quote`: The full, relevant quote or anecdote discussing $theme_focus concerns related to $topic.
- `summary`: A concise summary that captures the context or main idea of the quote.

The output structure should look like this:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "quote": "Full quote of a personal experience or opinion explicitly mentioning $theme_focus concerns in $topic",
      "summary": "A brief summary of the quote, providing context or the main idea"
    },
    {
      "quote": "Another relevant quote or anecdote about $theme_focus",
      "summary": "Summary or context of this second quote"
    }
  ]
}
```

If no quotes or relevant content about $theme_focus concerns are found in the data, return `null`.
